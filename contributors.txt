=== License: ===
 The Pack is Licensed under GPL.
 It does include proprietary graphics from Microsoft but those are installed only
 if you select "Win2-7 Restricted Extras" which would make the 
 Win2-7 Pack Proprietary and they are not selected by default. 
 As long as that option is not checked the Win2-7 Pack is GPL.
